      <h1>Martinique launches €15 million green transition fund for local SMEs</h1>
      <p>Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across Martinique have received a significant boost in their drive toward sustainability, as a new €15 million funding package is launched to support green transition initiatives across the island.</p>

      <h2>Overview of the program</h2>
      <p>The program — spearheaded by the French Development Agency (AFD) in partnership with the European Green Growth Fund (EGGF) and the Regional Council of Martinique — aims to accelerate the island’s economic transformation by promoting renewable energy, eco-innovation, and low-carbon development within local industries.</p>

      <h3>Key objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide low-interest loans for green investments.</li>
        <li>Offer innovation grants to startups and SMEs developing sustainable tech.</li>
        <li>Deliver technical assistance and training to local businesses.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Targeted sectors</h3>
      <p>The fund will primarily target Martinique’s agriculture, construction, tourism, and transport sectors, which together account for nearly 70% of the island’s carbon emissions.</p>

      <h4>Grants and loans breakdown</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>€3M reserved for innovation and R&amp;D projects.</li>
        <li>€8M allocated as low-interest loans for capital expenditures (solar, HVAC, etc.).</li>
        <li>€4M for technical assistance, training and pilot installations.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Case studies & quotes</h4>
      <p>“This investment is not just about funding projects,” said Isabelle Moreau, Regional Delegate for Economic Cooperation. “It’s about empowering local entrepreneurs to take the lead in building a more resilient and sustainable Martinique — one that creates jobs while protecting our natural heritage.”</p>

      <h5>Implementation timeline</h5>
      <p>Pilot installations are scheduled across the island within the first 12 months, with a rolling grant application process to follow.</p>

      <h6>Expected outcomes</h6>
      <p>By 2030, the project aims to reduce Martinique’s SME carbon emissions by 40% and create over 1,200 green jobs.</p>
